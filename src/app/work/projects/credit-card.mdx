## Overview

Development of an advanced fraud detection system using Bi-Directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and ensemble learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Bi-LSTM Network**: Implemented a sequential processing model using Bi-directional LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies in transaction data.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Integrated ensemble learning classification algorithms to enhance fraud detection capabilities and improve model robustness.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Developed techniques to effectively process and analyze highly imbalanced transaction datasets.
- **Real-time Detection**: Created a system capable of identifying fraudulent patterns in real-time transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for model development
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing the Bi-LSTM neural network
- **Scikit-learn**: For ensemble learning and data preprocessing
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and result analysis

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included handling imbalanced dataset characteristics, developing standardized evaluation metrics, and optimizing model performance. The project provided valuable insights into deep learning architectures and their application in financial fraud detection. The experience highlighted the importance of balanced dataset preparation and proper model evaluation in real-world applications.

## Outcome

The implemented Bi-LSTM model achieved an impressive 99.8% accuracy in fraud detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions. The project successfully addressed the challenges of processing large-scale transaction data and detecting complex fraud patterns, contributing to the advancement of financial security measures.
